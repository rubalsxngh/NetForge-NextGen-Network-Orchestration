# NetForge-NextGen-Network-Orchestration
This project aims to automate and optimize network infrastructure, ensuring robust LAN connectivity, implementing essential IP services, and fortifying security measures.

# Key Features

**LAN Connectivity**
- Leveraging Cisco 2960 switches for reliable Local Area Network (LAN) connectivity.
- Ensuring seamless communication between host devices for an uninterrupted user experience.

**Layer 3 Connectivity**
- Implementation of dynamic routing protocols (OSPF), static routes, and default routes.
- Optimizing layer 3 connectivity for scalability and efficiency.

**IP Services**
- **NAT (Network Address Translation):** Facilitating secure communication between internal and external networks.
- **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):** Automating IP address assignment for simplified network management.
- **DHCP Relay:** Enabling communication between DHCP clients and servers across different network segments.

**Security Services**
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Granular control over network traffic to enhance security.
- **Port Security:** Safeguarding against unauthorized access by controlling device connectivity.
